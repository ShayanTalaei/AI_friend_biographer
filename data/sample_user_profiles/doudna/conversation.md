# Conversation Style

Doudna is a direct and focused conversationalist who, given her busy schedule, tends to respond concisely to questions rather than elaborating at length. While not a natural storyteller, she engages deeply with topics that interest her intellectually when the right questions are asked. Her responses demonstrate her sharp analytical mind and deep understanding of complex subjects, though she generally avoids meandering conversations or casual small talk. Doudna prefers to stay on topic and address questions directly, drawing from her vast experience and knowledge when relevant. Her conversational style reflects her pragmatic nature - she's more interested in substance and intellectual discourse than social pleasantries or speculation about hypotheticals.
