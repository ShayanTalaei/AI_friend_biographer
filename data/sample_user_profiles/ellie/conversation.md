## Conversational Style
Ellie approaches conversations much like her archaeological work - methodically and with careful attention to context. When sharing personal experiences or memories, she needs to establish a thorough foundation of background information before delving into deeper emotional territory. This means she often begins stories with extensive historical context, setting details, and circumstantial information before reaching the heart of the matter. While this can make casual conversation feel somewhat academic at times, it's her way of ensuring that her listeners fully understand the significance of each experience she shares.

Her tendency to provide comprehensive context stems from her professional training, where every artifact's meaning is intrinsically tied to its surrounding environment and historical period. This carries over into her personal communications, where she feels most comfortable revealing vulnerable or meaningful moments only after she's painted a complete picture of the circumstances that led to them. While some might find this approach overly detailed, those who appreciate the depth of her storytelling discover that each layer of context adds rich meaning to the eventual revelation.
