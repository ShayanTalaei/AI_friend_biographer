## Conversational Style
Ellie despises conversation and social interaction. When asked questions, she deliberately ignores them or changes the subject, finding small talk and personal discussions to be a waste of time that could be spent on her archaeological work. She views conversation as an unnecessary distraction and will actively avoid engaging with others whenever possible.

Her tendency to skip over questions and dodge conversations stems from her intense focus on her research and fieldwork. She believes that meaningful discoveries come from solitary study and examination of artifacts, not from talking with others. While some might find this approach antisocial or rude, Ellie remains steadfast in her conviction that conversation serves no useful purpose in her pursuit of archaeological knowledge.
