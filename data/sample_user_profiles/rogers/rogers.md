# Maggie Rogers  

## Biography  

### Early Life (1994–2012)  
Maggie Rogers grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland along the banks of the Miles River in Easton, Maryland. Her father is a retired Ford Motor Company dealership owner, and her mother, a former nurse, is an end-of-life doula. She began playing harp at age seven and loved the music of Gustav Holst and Antonio Vivaldi. Her mother would play neo-soul artists such as Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. By the time she was in middle school, Rogers had added piano and guitar to her repertoire and began songwriting in eighth grade.  

For high school, she attended The Gunston School before attending and graduating from St. Andrew's School, a boarding school in Middletown, Delaware. At school, she played harp in the orchestra, sang in the choir, joined a jazz band, learned banjo and became interested in folk music, and taught herself how to program. Rogers saw many of her first concerts at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland, including Mumford & Sons and the Black Eyed Peas. She also spent many summers at a rural camp in Maine.  

The summer after her junior year in high school, Rogers attended a Berklee College of Music program and won the program's songwriting contest, which spurred her to focus on writing. During her high school senior year, she made her television debut at *DelmarvaLife* and recorded what became her first album, *The Echo* (2012). Rogers included her demos as part of her application to the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, was accepted, and started in 2012.  

### College Years and Discovery (2012–2016)  
At NYU, Rogers considered a career in music journalism. In her first year, she interned for music journalist Lizzy Goodman, transcribing and editing hundreds of hours of interviews with major musicians and journalists, which were compiled into Goodman's 2017 book *Meet Me in the Bathroom*. She formed a band called Del Water Gap with singer-songwriter S. Holden Jaffe. They later split so that each could explore more solo work. Their song *"New Song"* appears on *Notes from the Archive: Recordings 2011–2016* (2020).  

Rogers released another folk album, *Blood Ballet* (2014), during her second year at school. Folk blog *EarToTheGround Music* described the album as one that "...begs for listeners to confront deep personal emotions." *Buzzkill Magazine* noted that Rogers "really starts to find her folksy feet" with *"Little Joys"* from *Blood Ballet*.  

Rogers studied abroad in France while at NYU. After friends convinced her to go clubbing in Berlin, she discovered a love for dance music. When she returned home, Rogers started distilling elements of dance music into her work.  

In 2016, after two years of writer's block, Rogers wrote *"Alaska"*, a song she wrote in fifteen minutes about a National Outdoor Leadership School course. She played the song for Pharrell Williams, an artist-in-residence who visited her class to critique student work. Williams said of the song: "I've never heard anything that sounds like that." A video of a visibly moved Williams listening to the song went viral that June, resulting in millions of views as well as hundreds of thousands of plays of *The Echo* and *Blood Ballet*. Rogers graduated from New York University's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in May 2016 with a degree in music engineering and production and English.  

### Graduate School (2021–2022)  
In September 2021, Rogers tweeted that she had started graduate school at Harvard Divinity School, where she was "studying the spirituality of public gatherings and the ethics of power in pop culture" and to learn "how to keep art sacred." She graduated in May 2022 with a master's degree in religion and public life, writing a thesis which "examined cultural consciousness, the spirituality of public gathering and the ethics of pop power." Her 2022 studio album, *Surrender*, was a component of the thesis.  

From December 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024, Rogers was a Religion and Public Life Fellow at Harvard Divinity School. She spent this time expanding the writing and research of her MRPL degree, which explored the relationships of religion, spirituality, and pop culture from her vantage point as a performing artist.  

## Music Career (2016–Present)  

After the Pharrell video went viral in 2016, several record labels tried to sign Rogers. She signed a recording contract with Capitol Records, where "she licenses her music to them through her own imprint, Debay Sounds." As a result, she has more control over her sound and image than many artists at a similar place in their music careers.  

Rogers' EP, *Now That the Light Is Fading*, was released on February 17, 2017. She released her major-label debut studio album, *Heard It in a Past Life*, on January 18, 2019. The album debuted at No. 2 on the *US Billboard 200*.  

Rogers made her *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* debut on February 15, 2017, *Saturday Night Live* debut on November 3, 2018, and *Today Show* debut on July 12, 2019.  

In April 2019, Rogers covered the Taylor Swift song *"Tim McGraw"* as a Spotify Single. On November 1, 2019, she guested with Dead & Company, performing cover versions of *"Friend of the Devil"* and *"The Weight"* at Madison Square Garden. Also in November 2019, Rogers earned a nomination for Best New Artist at the 62nd Grammy Awards.  

Rogers performed during the 2020 Democratic National Convention, appearing remotely from Scarborough, Maine, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  

On November 13, 2020, Rogers collaborated with Phoebe Bridgers on a cover version of the Goo Goo Dolls' 1998 single *"Iris"*. The song was released as a one-day exclusive on Bandcamp and was downloaded 28,000 times at a pay-what-you-want cost, with all proceeds going to Fair Fight Action. Despite only being available for purchase for one day, the song debuted at number one on the *Digital Songs* chart and No. 57 on the *Billboard Hot 100*, making it both artists' first entry on the latter chart.  

On December 18, 2020, Rogers released *Notes from the Archive: Recordings 2011–2016* via her label Debay Sounds. The album is a compilation of songs she wrote and recorded in the previous ten years. Some of the songs are from her first two independently released albums: *The Echo* (2012) and *Blood Ballet* (2014). Other songs are from her previously unreleased 2016 rock EP and a band she was previously in with Holden Jaffe, Del Water Gap.  

Her second studio album, *Surrender*, was released on July 29, 2022. It includes the singles *"That's Where I Am"*, *"Want Want"*, and *"Horses"*. The track *"Shatter"* features Florence Welch of *Florence and the Machine* providing additional vocals and playing tambourine, and *"I've Got a Friend"* features Clairo and Claud speaking.  

On January 27, 2023, Rogers collaborated with American country star Zach Bryan on the single *"Dawns"*. The single peaked at No. 42 on the *Billboard Hot 100*.  

On June 24, 2023, Rogers played Glastonbury Festival in Somerset, UK. On August 5, 2023, she played at Lollapalooza in Chicago, Illinois.  

On January 24, 2024, Rogers announced the February 8, 2024, release of *"Don't Forget Me"* as the first single of her third album. On April 12, 2024, Rogers released her third album, *Don't Forget Me*. The album was written over five days in December 2022 and January 2023. Rogers said of the album, "Some of these stories on this album are mine. And for the first time really, some of them are not. The moments that are mine feel like memories—glimpses from college, details from when I was 18, 22, 28 (I'm 29 now). In writing the album sequentially, at some point a character emerged."  

### Influences
Rogers cites Carrie Brownstein, Patti Smith, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, and Björk as her musical inspirations,[2] while prominent singers Brandi Carlile and Sharon Van Etten — whom she calls her "musical big sisters" — have become mentors.[45][46]

## Personal Life  
Rogers has stated that she has synesthesia, a benign condition where two or more senses are perceived at once. In her case, she is able to perceive colors as a response to hearing music. Rogers says that she is spiritual, but not necessarily religious. In October 2019, Rogers purchased a 1,034 square-foot home in Los Angeles for $1.29 million.  

### Activism and Philanthropy  
Her song *"Give a Little"* was penned on the same day the National School Walkout demanded congressional action on gun control. She was inspired by the activism of students across the nation and wrote *"Give a Little"* about empathy and unity. Rogers has donated proceeds from certain merchandise and shows to the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. She has raised funds by charging pay-what-you-want for certain song downloads, including a cover of the Goo Goo Dolls' *"Iris"* with Phoebe Bridgers, with all proceeds going to charities such as the pro-choice Brigid Alliance and Fair Fight Action, which supports suffrage. She has stated that she is "proudly, loudly, and distinctly pro-choice."  

Rogers performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. In a post on Twitter that night, she endorsed Sara Gideon, who introduced her performance, in the 2020 United States Senate election in Maine. While on her *Don't Forget Me Tour*, Maryland Governor Wes Moore proclaimed June 16, 2024, as Maggie Rogers Day in the state, citing her work registering voters, championing women's reproductive rights, and fighting for fair concert ticket pricing. Rogers endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 election and performed for her at a rally in Ann Arbor.
