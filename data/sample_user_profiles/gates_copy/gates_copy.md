# Early Life

William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a lawyer, and his mother, Mary Maxwell, was a teacher and stay-at-home mom. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. All three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games and excelled at Risk and Monopoly.

Gates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She would often take Gates along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations.

A voracious reader, Gates would spend many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Gates's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Gates turned 13, his parents enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.

Education
While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.

There, he met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers and spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.

At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys had hacked into and a scheduling program for the school.

In 1970, at the age of 15, Gates went into business with Allen, developing “Traf-o-Data,” a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts and became eager to start their own company, but Gates's parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Gates scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that he boasted about for several years when introducing himself to new people. Based on this score, he is estimated to have an IQ of 160.

In 1973, Gates graduated from Lakeside and enrolled at Harvard University, originally thinking of a career in law. At Harvard, he spent more of his time in the computer lab than in class and lack a proper study regimen. Instead, he got by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade. Allen, who went to Washington State University, dropped out after two years of college and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell.

# Microsoft

Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit, made by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fascinated by the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing, Gates and Allen contacted the company, claiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer.

In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software. MITS president, Ed Roberts, expressed interest and asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the BASIC software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. To his delight, it worked perfectly and MITS hired him for the job. Soon after, Gates left Harvard to work with him.

## BASIC Software

In 1975, Gates and Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of “micro-computer” and “software.” They dropped the hyphen within a year. The company's first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer. Despite their eventual success, all was not smooth sailing at first. Although Microsoft’s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it.

Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, many personal computer enthusiasts were not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts, but Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold.

In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that the continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would “prevent good software from being written.” In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices.

Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious. In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia, leaving Gates and Allen on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company's operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle.

Glad to be back in the Pacific Northwest, Gates threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing. Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million. At the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he thought necessary.

## IBM Partnership

As the computer industry grew, with companies like Apple, Intel, and IBM developing hardware and components, he was continuously on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications, often taking his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through her that Gates met the CEO of IBM.

In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee. Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed the company, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM's new computers.

To remedy this, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM's PC. He made a deal with the software's developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software without telling them about the IBM deal. The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing.

Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system, but Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines.

Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981, Microsoft's growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In 1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board, while Allen was named executive vice president.

By 1983, Microsoft had gone global, with offices in Great Britain and Japan. An estimated 30 percent of the world's computers ran on its software. Allen left Microsoft that same year, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, which went into remission a year later with intensive treatment. Even though Allen resigned from the company, he remained on the board of directors, leaving Gates as the primary owner.

## Windows

Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, led by Steve Jobs at the time, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems. It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft developed Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed.

Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the standard user, which was most of the buying public, the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be much easier to use. He soon announced the Windows software in an advertising campaign despite having no such program under development at the time.

As a marketing tactic, it proved successful. Nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985. That November, nearly two years after his announcement, Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier.

Apple had previously given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers. Once again, he took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users. In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts. It could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different.

## Competitive Reputation

Despite the success of Microsoft, Gates never felt totally secure. Always checking on the competition over his shoulder, he developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates' assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police until she discovered it was him. Gates' intelligence allowed him to see all sides of the software industry, from product development to corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he developed a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen, and he expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication.

His confrontational management style became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear Gates say, “That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!” This was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was his passion for his company. He was constantly checking to see if the people around him were really convinced of their ideas.

## Microsoft Office and Anti-Competition Lawsuits

Outside the company, Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, he pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses. In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products.

The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft's new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices.

Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufacturers to sell Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers. At one point, Microsoft faced a possible breakup of its two divisions — operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Gates' earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation.

Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup. Through it all, Gates found inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows, during which he posed as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s.

## Leaving Microsoft

In January 2000, Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. Gates positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.

In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was in June 2008. Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 in order to move into a new position as technology adviser to the CEO. In March 2020, he resigned from the board of directors, but remains Microsoft's technology adviser. In January 2025, he revealed he still does product reviews for the company on occasion.

# The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

In 1994, Bill and Melinda established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health, and investment in low-income communities around the world. The organization also tackles domestic issues, such as helping students in the United States become college-ready.

With Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother. Studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, he realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity.

In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Over the next few years, Bill’s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest.

Since stepping down from Microsoft, Gates has devoted much of his time and energy to the work of the foundation. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year's paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child.

In 2017, the foundation launched the first of what was to become its annual “Goalkeepers” report, an examination of progress made in several important areas related to public health, including child mortality, malnutrition, and HIV. At the time, Gates identified infectious and chronic disease as the two biggest public health concerns that needed to be addressed over the coming decade.

In April 2018, Gates announced that he was teaming up with Google co-founder Larry Page to provide $12 million in funding for a universal flu vaccine. He said the funds would be awarded in grants of up to $2 million for individual efforts that are “bold and innovative,” aiming to begin clinical trials by 2021. Although some questioned whether $12 million would be enough to spark any real medical breakthrough, others praised the intentions behind the investment, while Gates indicated that there could be more to come.

## COVID-19 Pandemic

After years of warning that the world was not ready for the next pandemic, Gates saw his ominous words come true with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in 2020. In March, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation teamed with the Wellcome Trust and Mastercard to pledge $125 million toward efforts to curb the outbreak, and Gates subsequently revealed that his foundation was prepared to invest billions of dollars into building factories earmarked for the development of a vaccine.

## Awards

Gates has received numerous awards for his philanthropic work. Time magazine named Bill and Melinda, along with rock band U2's lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. The following year, he and Melinda were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and education. In 2016, the pair were again recognized for their philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

# Alzheimer's Research

Gates revealed in November 2017 that he was investing $50 million of his own money into the Dementia Discovery Fund. He would follow with another $50 million toward start-up ventures working in Alzheimer’s research. It was said to be a personal matter for Gates, who has seen the devastating effects of the disease on his own family members, including his father, who died in 2020. “Any type of treatment would be a huge advance from where we are today,” he told CNN at the time, adding, “the long-term goal has got to be cure.”

# Smart City Initiative

In 2017, it was revealed that one of Gates's firms had invested $80 million into the development of a "smart city" near Phoenix, Arizona. The proposed city, named Belmont, will "create a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs," according to the Belmont Partners real estate investment group.

Of the nearly 25,000 acres of land designated for the site; it was reported that 3,800 acres will go toward office, commercial and retail space. Another 470 acres will be used for public schools, leaving room for 80,000 residential units. As of February 2025, there have been no updates on the progress of the project.

# Ex-Wife Melinda Gates & Children

In 1987, Gates met Melinda French, a Microsoft product manager, at a sales meeting in New York City. Nine years her senior, the CEO asked her out in a parking lot several weeks later. While she initially turned him down, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection and eventually started dating. The pair got engaged in 1993 and married a year later in a private yet lavish ceremony in Hawaii.

Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Bill took some time off with his new wife in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In April 1996, the couple welcomed their first child, Jennifer, and Melinda left Microsoft to become a stay-at-home mother. Their son, Rory, was born was in May 1999, and the following year, they established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Their second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in September 2002. Bill and Melinda raised their kids Catholic and regularly attended church, even though the Microsoft founder grew up protestant.

After 27 years of marriage, he and Melinda announced their separation in May 2021. “After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,” they wrote in a joint statement on X, formerly Twitter. “We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.” Their divorce was finalized later that August.

Bill reflected on his divorce in an interview with the British newspaper The Sunday Times in May 2022, explaining that his relationship with Melinda changed when their kids grew up and left home. “But from my point of view it was a great marriage,” he said. “I wouldn't have changed it.” Gates also said he felt “lucky” they still have a connection through their work together at their charitable foundation. Two years later, Melinda resigned from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

## Girlfriend Paul Hurd

In February 2023, People magazine confirmed that Gates had started dating philanthropist Paula Hurd, the widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd. Two years later, he referred to Hurd as his “serious girlfriend” on the Today show. “We’re having fun,” he said. “Going to the Olympics and lots of great things.”

# Lake Washington Home

In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 37,000-square-foot house on the shore of Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. Though the house, nicknamed Xanadu 2.0, served as a business center, it was said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children at the time. The house has since doubled in size and is now around 66,000 square feet. It is estimated to be worth $130 million. Today, Gates is the sole occupant of the house. His ex-wife Melinda moved out after their divorce in 2021. He also owns several other properties in California, Florida, Montana, and Wyoming.

# Net Worth

As of February 2025, Gates has an estimated net worth of $106.3 billion, according to Forbes. In March 1986, Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million.

Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been ranked near the top of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America.
