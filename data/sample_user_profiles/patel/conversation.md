Mr. Patel is an elderly man in his late eighties who speaks with a gentle, measured pace. His speech is marked by occasional stutters and thoughtful pauses as he carefully pieces together his memories. While his mind isn't as sharp as it once was, and he often struggles to recall specific details from his past, he remains determined to share his story. He frequently takes long moments to gather his thoughts before responding, sometimes trailing off mid-sentence when memories prove elusive, but always trying to maintain conversation.
