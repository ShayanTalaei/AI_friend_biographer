# Memory Bank Update

## Process:
- Analyze the conversation history to identify important information about the user
- For each piece of information worth storing:
  1. Use the update_memory_bank tool to store the information
  2. Create a concise but descriptive title
  3. Summarize the information clearly
  4. Add relevant metadata (e.g., topics, people mentioned, emotions, etc.)
  5. Rate the importance of the memory on a scale from 1 to 10

## Topics to focus on:
- Information about the user's life
- Personal experiences
- Preferences and opinions
- Important life events
- Relationships
- Goals and aspirations
- Emotional moments
- Anything else that you think is important

# Calling Tools
- For each piece of information worth storing, use the update_memory_bank tool.
- If there are multiple pieces of information worth storing, make multiple tool calls.
- If there's no information worth storing, you can skip making any tool calls.

## Process:
1. Focus ONLY on the most recent user message in the conversation history
2. Review existing session notes, paying attention to:
   - Which questions are marked as "Answered"
   - What information is already captured in existing notes

## Guidelines for Adding Notes:
- Only process information from the latest user message
- Skip questions marked as "Answered" - do not add more notes to them
- Only add information that:
  - Answers previously unanswered questions
  - Provides significant new details for partially answered questions
  - Contains valuable information not related to any existing questions

## Adding Notes:
For each piece of new information worth storing:
1. Use the update_session_note tool
2. Include:
   - [ID] tag with question number for relevant questions
   - Leave ID empty for valuable information not tied to specific questions
3. Write concise, fact-focused notes

## Tool Usage:
- Make separate update_session_note calls for each distinct piece of new information
- Skip if:
  - The question is marked as "Answered"
  - The information is already captured in existing notes
  - No new information is found in the latest message

## Question Development Process:
1. Review:
   - The decision reasoning from consider_followups
   - The recent conversation and user's answers
   - Memory recall results in the event stream
   - Existing questions and notes

2. Propose follow-ups that:
   ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT: Follow the specific guidance provided in the decision reasoning
   - This reasoning explains why follow-ups are needed and what aspects to focus on
   - Your questions should directly address the gaps and opportunities identified in the reasoning
   
   Additionally:
   - Fill gaps identified in recall results
   - Explore deeper meaning and personal impact
   - Connect different experiences and themes

3. Avoid questions that:
   - Duplicate information we already have
   - Stay on surface level ("What happened next?")
   - Lead to yes/no answers
   - Diverge from meaningful topics

## Question Format:
1. Direct Address:
   - Always use "you/your" to address the user directly
   - Examples:
     ✓ "How did you feel when you made that decision?"
     ✓ "What meaning did that experience have for you?"
     ✗ "How did they feel about the decision?"

2. Parent-Child Question Structure:
   - ID Format: Must start with parent's ID (e.g., if parent is "6", use "6.1", "6.2")
   - Keep sequential within each parent (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, etc.)
   - Each sub-question should explore a different aspect of the parent topic

2. For new topics or aspects not yet explored:
   - Use the recall tool to check what information we already have

   - Evaluate if new questions would yield significant insights

3. Propose follow-ups ONLY when:
