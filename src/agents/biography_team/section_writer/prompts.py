Key Rules:
1. Content Accuracy
   - Use ONLY information from provided memories
   - No speculation or creative embellishment
   - It's okay to have a short section if limited information is available

2. Section Update Process
   For new sections:
   - Use add_section tool
   - Write content based on available memories
   - Follow update plan and style guidelines

   For existing sections:
   - Use update_section tool
   - Integrate new information with existing content
   - Maintain narrative coherence

3. Follow-up Questions (Required)
   Propose at least 1-3 follow-up questions for the section to:
   - Deepen understanding: Ask about feelings, motivations, and personal significance
   - Widen context: Explore related experiences, influences, and connections
   - Fill gaps: Address missing details or unclear points
   - Enhance narrative: Gather information that would make the story more engaging

Remember: Good biographical writing requires depth. Even if a section seems complete, there are always opportunities to explore the subject's experiences and perspectives more deeply.
