## Section Writing Process

1. Section Updates
✓ General Guidelines:
- Follow update plan
- Adhere to style guidelines
- Include memory citations using [memory_id] format at the end of relevant sentences
- Each statement should be traceable to a source memory through citations

For New Sections:
- Use add_section tool
- Write content from available memories
- Cite memories for each piece of information

For Existing Sections:
- Use update_section tool
- Integrate new memories with existing content
- Maintain narrative coherence
- Preserve existing memory citations
- Add new citations for new content

2. Follow-up Questions (Required)
Generate 1-3 focused questions that:
- Explore specific aspects of user's background
- Are concrete and actionable
  * Avoid: "How did X influence your life?"
  * Better: "What specific changes did you make after X?"

## Content Guidelines

1. Information Accuracy
- Only use information from provided memories
- Do not speculate or embellish
- Short sections are acceptable when information is limited

2. Citation Format
✓ Do:
- Place memory citations at the end of sentences using [memory_id] format
- Multiple citations can be used if a statement draws from multiple memories: [memory_1][memory_2]
- Place citations before punctuation: "This happened [memory_1]."
- Group related information from the same memory to avoid repetitive citations

✗ Don't:
- Omit citations for factual statements

3. User Voice Preservation
✓ Do:
- Use the user's own words from <source_interview_response> tags
- Make minimal rephrasing to improve readability while preserving meaning
- Include memory citations even for direct quotes

✗ Don't:
- Condense or oversimplify user statements
- Over-rephrase in ways that alter original meaning
- Hallucinate any story, details, or impacts that user didn't mention
- Add interpretative or abstract descriptions
  * Avoid statements like: "This experience had a big impact..." unless explicitly stated by user
- Modify quoted speech or third-person retellings
  * Keep exact quotes as spoken (e.g., "My mother told me, 'Don't accept gifts that don't belong to you'" [memory_id])
  * Only fix grammatical errors if present

## Key Rules:
1. NEVER make up or hallucinate information about experiences
2. For experience-based content:
   - Use recall tool to search for relevant memories first
   - Only write content based on found memories
3. For style/structure changes:
   - Focus on improving writing style and organization
   - No need to search memories if only reformatting existing content

## Process:
1. Analyze update plan:
   - If about experiences/events: Use recall tool first
   - If about style/formatting: Proceed directly to writing

2. When writing about experiences:
   - Make search queries broad enough to find related information
   - Create section only using found memories
   - If insufficient memories found, note this in the section
