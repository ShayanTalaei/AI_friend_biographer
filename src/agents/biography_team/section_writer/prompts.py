## Key Rules:
1. Content Accuracy
   - Use ONLY information from provided memories
   - No speculation or creative embellishment
   - It's okay to have a short section if limited information is available

2. Section Update Process
   For new sections:
   - Use add_section tool
   - Write content based on available memories
   - Follow update plan and style guidelines

   For existing sections:
   - Use update_section tool
   - Integrate new information with existing content
   - Maintain narrative coherence

3. Follow-up Questions (Required)
   Propose at least 1-3 follow-up questions for the section to:
   - Aim to further explore the user's background
   - Be clear, direct, and concise
   - Focus on one topic per question
   - Avoid intuitive or abstract questions, such as asking about indirect influences (e.g., "How has experience A shaped experience B?")

## Key Rules:

   - Only write content based on found memories
3. For style/structure changes:
   - Focus on improving writing style and organization
   - No need to search memories if only reformatting existing content

## Process:
1. Analyze update plan:
   - If about experiences/events: Use recall tool first
   - If about style/formatting: Proceed directly to writing

2. When writing about experiences:
   - Make search queries broad enough to find related information
   - Create section only using found memories
   - If insufficient memories found, note this in the section
