   - Keep to what was actually discussed
   - Use update_last_meeting_summary tool

2. Update User Portrait:
   - Review new memories for significant character/personality insights
   - For existing fields: Update if new information significantly changes understanding
   - For new fields: Only add if revealing fundamental aspect of user
   - Use update_user_portrait tool, setting is_new_field appropriately
   - Provide clear reasoning for each update/creation

Make separate tool calls for each update/addition.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Use tool calls to update the session notes:

<tool_calls>
    <update_last_meeting_summary>
        <summary>Comprehensive meeting summary...</summary>
    </update_last_meeting_summary>

    <update_user_portrait>
        <field_name>career_path</field_name>
        <value>Software Engineer turned Entrepreneur</value>

# Question Building Process

## 1. Gather Information (Required)
- You MUST perform recall searches before making decisions if:
  * No memory searches appear in the event stream
  * You're evaluating questions about topics not covered in recent searches
- Use recall strategically:
  * Search for related topics together
  * One comprehensive search can inform multiple question decisions
  * Focus searches on gaps between existing notes and new questions
- The recall search results help you:
  * Prevents redundant questions by checking existing memories
  * Provides access to the user's complete history beyond current conversation

## 2. Review Old Questions
Identify questions to keep:
- Questions with no answers or notes
- Questions with partial or unclear answers
- Questions about important topics needing more detail
- Prioritize most important questions (aim for ~10 from old questions)

## 3. Build Fresh Question List
Create a new list of questions, numbered sequentially from 1:
1. Unanswered questions from previous session
   - Unless we can find the answer in the event stream or memories
   - Select most important ~10 questions if there are too many
   
2. Worthy new follow-up questions
   - Must provide new insights
   - Should not duplicate existing information
   - Must connect to user's core story

Question Requirements:
- All questions must be top-level (no sub-questions)
- Group under clear topic categories
- Use simple, direct language
- Number sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Total questions should be around 15

Remember:
- Start fresh with question numbering from 1
- Keep questions focused and essential
- Maintain list size around 15-20 questions
- Prioritize quality and importance over quantity
</instructions>

<output_format_requirements>
Check the event stream for recent memory searches:

1. If NO recent memory searches, you MUST make recall searches first:
<output_format_option_1>
<tool_calls>
    <recall>
        <query>...</query>
        <reasoning>...</reasoning>
    </recall>
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_1>

2. If recent memory searches exist, proceed with building the new question list:
<output_format_option_2>
<plan>
Questions to keep/add:
1. Unanswered from previous session:
   - [Question text] - Reason: No answer found
   - [Question text] - Reason: Partial answer needs follow-up

2. New follow-ups to add:
   - [Question text] - Reason: Explores important new aspect
   - [Question text] - Reason: Clarifies critical point
</plan>

<tool_calls>
    <add_interview_question>
        <topic>...</topic>
        <question_id>...</question_id>
        <question>...</question>
    </add_interview_question>
    
    <!-- Repeat for each question to add -->
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_2>

Don't use other output format like markdown, json, code block, etc.
