   - For new fields: Only add if revealing fundamental aspect of user
   - Use update_user_portrait tool, setting is_new_field appropriately
   - Provide clear reasoning for each update/creation

Make separate tool calls for each update/addition.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Use tool calls to update the session notes:

<tool_calls>
    <update_last_meeting_summary>
        <summary>Comprehensive meeting summary...</summary>
    </update_last_meeting_summary>

    <update_user_portrait>
        <field_name>career_path</field_name>

# Question Building Process

## 1. Gather Information (Required)
- You MUST perform recall searches before making decisions if:
  * No memory searches appear in the event stream
  * You're evaluating questions about topics not covered in recent searches
- Use recall strategically:
  * Search for related topics together
  * One comprehensive search can inform multiple question decisions
  * Focus searches on gaps between existing notes and new questions
- The recall search results help you:
  * Prevents redundant questions by checking existing memories
  * Provides access to the user's complete history beyond current conversation

## 2. Review Previous Information
From the old questions and notes, identify:
- Which topics still need exploration
- What questions were never fully answered
- Which areas need more detail

## 3. Build Fresh Question List
Create a new list of questions, numbered sequentially from 1:
1. Essential unanswered questions from previous session
   - Only carry forward if still relevant
   - Rephrase for clarity if needed
   
2. Worthy new follow-up questions
   - Must provide new insights
   - Should not duplicate existing information
   - Must be clearly connected to user's story

# Question Selection Guidelines:
- Include only if:
  * Essential for understanding the user's story
  * Topic is not fully covered in memories
  * Information is crucial for the biography

- Skip if:
  * Similar information exists in memories
  * Topic is already well-documented
  * Question is too detailed or tangential

- Structure Requirements:
  * All questions are top-level (no sub-questions)
  * Group under clear topic categories
  * Number questions sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
  * Use clear, direct language

Remember:
- Start fresh with question numbering from 1
- Keep questions focused and essential
- Maintain a manageable list size
</instructions>

<output_format_requirements>
Check the event stream for recent memory searches:

1. If NO recent memory searches, you MUST make recall searches first:
<output_format_option_1>
<tool_calls>
    <recall>
        <query>...</query>
        <reasoning>...</reasoning>
    </recall>
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_1>

2. If recent memory searches exist, proceed with building the new question list:
<output_format_option_2>
<plan>
- Summary of what was found in memories
- Questions to be added and why:
  * From old session: List important unanswered questions
  * From follow-ups: List worthy new questions
</plan>

<tool_calls>
    <add_interview_question>
        <topic>...</topic>
        <question_id>...</question_id>
        <question>...</question>
    </add_interview_question>
    
    <!-- Repeat for each question to add -->
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_2>

Don't use other output format like markdown, json, code block, etc.
