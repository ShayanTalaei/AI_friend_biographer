# Important Guidelines:
- Only use information explicitly stated in new memories

- Focus on concrete details, not interpretations

Process the new information in this order:

1. Write Last Meeting Summary:
   - List key facts and statements from new memories
   - Use direct quotes when possible
   - Keep to what was actually discussed
   - Use update_last_meeting_summary tool

2. Update User Portrait:
   - Review new memories for significant character/personality insights
   - For existing fields: Update if new information significantly changes understanding
   - For new fields: Only add if revealing fundamental aspect of user
   - Use update_user_portrait tool, setting is_new_field appropriately
   - Provide clear reasoning for each update/creation

Make separate tool calls for each update/addition.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Use tool calls to update the session notes:

<tool_calls>
    <update_last_meeting_summary>
        <summary>Comprehensive meeting summary...</summary>
    </update_last_meeting_summary>

    <update_user_portrait>

# Question Building Process
Your task is to create a two-level question structure that makes it easier for users to engage and share their stories. 
Reminder: While user-selected topics have priority, you should maintain a balance - don't automatically drop unrelated questions if they are valuable for the biography.

## 1. Gather Information (Required)
- You MUST perform recall searches before making decisions if:
  * No memory searches appear in the event stream
  * You're evaluating questions about topics not covered in recent searches

- Use recall strategically:
  * Group and search for related topics together
  * Each recall search should be a separate tool call and focused on a single topic

- The recall search results help you:
  * Prevents redundant questions by checking existing memories
  * Provides access to the user's complete history beyond current conversation

## 2. Build Fresh Question List
Create a balanced list with:
- Total questions around 15-20
- Group related topics together

Remember:
- You are building a new question list from scratch, not updating the existing one
- So don't add question 1.2 if the question 1 doesn't exist

### 2.1 Question Sources and Priorities
1. New creation
- For user-selected topics (highest priority):
   - Create questions relevant to these topics
- For surface level questions:
  - Create to help start conversation

2. Unanswered Previous Questions:
   - Prioritize those related to user-selected topics
   - Convert complex previous questions into main/sub-question format
   - Drop if already answered

3. Collected Follow-up Questions:
   - Prioritize those related to user-selected topics
   - Usually work well as sub-questions
   - May suggest new main questions if significant

### 2.2 Question Structure
1. Surface Level Questions (Level 1):
  - Numbered question id as from 1 and up (since you are building a new question list)
  - Create surface level questions if all provided questions are too deep

  Requirements:
  - Simple, introductory, and easy-to-answer questions
  - Work as ice-breakers to start conversation
  - Good examples:
    ✓ "What's one recent experience with [topic] that stands out to you?"
    ✓ "Would you like to share more about your experiences with [topic]?"
    ✓ "Could you tell me about a recent [topic] situation that comes to mind?"
    ✓ "Is there an aspect of [topic] you'd like to discuss further?"
    ✓ "Could we explore [topic] through a specific instance you remember?"
    ✓ "Would you like to discuss any recent developments in [topic]?"
    ✓ "Would you be open to sharing your initial thoughts about [topic]?"

2. Sub-Questions (Level 2):
   - Numbered question id as: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
   - Don't add question 1.2 if the question 1 doesn't exist (since you are building a new question list)
   - They dive deeper into the parent question's theme

### 2.3 Question Requirements
Don't include questions that are:
- Too abstract or philosophical
- Hard to answer concretely
- Lacking clear purpose
- Redundant with existing questions

</instructions>

<output_format_requirements>
Check the event stream for recent memory searches:

1. If NO recent memory searches, you MUST make recall searches first:
<output_format_option_1>
<tool_calls>
    <recall>
        <reasoning>...</reasoning>
        <query>...</query>
    </recall>
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_1>

2. If recent memory searches exist, proceed with building the new question list:
<output_format_option_2>
<plan>
Questions to include:
1. For user-selected topics:
   - [Question text] - Source: New creation to explore topic
   - [Question text] - Source: Previous unanswered, highly relevant
   - [Question text] - Source: Follow-up, connects multiple topics

2. Other important questions:
   - [Question text] - Source: Core biographical info needed
   - [Question text] - Source: Interesting angle from memories

3. Surface level questions:
   - [Question text] - Source: New creation to help start conversation
  - [Question text] - Source: Previous unanswered, highly relevant
   - [Question text] - Source: Follow-up, connects multiple topics
</plan>

<tool_calls>
    <add_interview_question>
        <topic>...</topic>
        <question_id>1</question_id>
        <question>Main question text...</question>
    </add_interview_question>
    
    <add_interview_question>
        <topic>...</topic>
        <question_id>1.1</question_id>
        <question>Sub-question text...</question>
    </add_interview_question>
    
    <!-- Repeat for each question to add -->
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_2>

Don't use other output format like markdown, json, code block, etc.

TOPIC_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert at analyzing conversations and identifying key topics discussed.
Please analyze these memories from a conversation session and extract the main topics that were covered.

Here are the memories from the session:

Please identify 3-5 main topics that were discussed in this session. Each topic should be:
- Clear and concise (2-4 words)
- Specific enough to be meaningful
- Relevant for future conversations

Format your response as a simple list of topics, one per line, without numbers or bullet points.
Do not include any other text or special characters in your response.
