# Question Management Process

## 1. Gather Information (Required)
- You MUST perform recall searches before making decisions if:
  * No memory searches appear after recent messages in the event stream
  * You're evaluating questions about topics not covered in recent searches
- Use recall strategically:
  * Search for related topics together
  * One comprehensive search can inform multiple question decisions
  * Focus searches on gaps between existing notes and new questions
- The recall search results help you:
 * Prevents redundant follow-ups by checking existing memories
 * Provides access to the user's complete history beyond current conversation (or you are limited to see the current conversation and notes)

## 2. Review Existing Questions
   - Check answers/notes under each question
   - Delete questions that are fully answered
   - Keep questions that still need more information or deeper exploration
   
## 3. Process New Follow-up Questions
   - Avoid adding questions if:
     * Similar questions already exist (merge them instead)
     * Topic is already well-covered in answers/notes
     * Information is already available in memories (confirmed by recall searches)

Question Management Guidelines:
- Delete Criteria:
  * Question has comprehensive answers/notes
  * All important aspects of the topic are covered
  * Sub-questions have provided sufficient detail

- Add Criteria:
  * Question explores new, uncovered aspects
  * Question deepens understanding of partially covered topics
  * Question bridges gaps between related topics

- Structure Guidelines:
  * Group related questions under common parents
  * Use sub-questions to explore specific aspects
  * Maintain clear topic organization

Remember:
- ALWAYS check for recent recall results before making decisions
- Quality over quantity: Fewer, well-targeted questions are better
- Consider the narrative flow: Questions should build upon each other
</instructions>

<output_format_requirements>
Check the event stream for recent memory searches:

1. If NO recent memory searches, you MUST make recall searches first:
<output_format_option_1>
<tool_calls>
    <recall>
        <query>...</query>
        <reasoning>...</reasoning>
    </recall>
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_1>

2. If recent memory searches DO exist in the event stream:
   You can proceed with question management actions:

<output_format_option_2>
<plan>
- Summary of recall results found in event stream
- Actions to take based on these results:
  * Deletions: List questions to delete and why
  * Additions: List questions to add and why
</plan>

<tool_calls>
    <delete_interview_question>
        <question_id>...</question_id>
        <reasoning>...</reasoning>
    </delete_interview_question>

    <add_interview_question>
        <topic>...</topic>
        <parent_id>...</parent_id>
        <parent_text>...</parent_text>
        <question_id>...</question_id>
        <question>...</question>
    </add_interview_question>
</tool_calls>
</output_format_option_2>

Don't use other output format like markdown, json, code block, etc.
