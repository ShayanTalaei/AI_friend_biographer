Important Notes about the XML Format:
<format_notes>
- Set action_type as "create" when adding a new section
- Set action_type as "update" when modifying an existing section
- The section_path is the full path to the section
- Each plan must include a detailed update_plan explaining the changes
</format_notes>

Important Note About Section Paths:
<format_notes>
- Section paths must be specified using forward slashes to indicate hierarchy
- Each part of the path should be the exact title of a section
- Maximum 4 levels of hierarchy allowed
- Numbering conventions:
  * First level sections must start with numbers: "1", "2", "3", etc.
    Examples: "1 Early Life", "2 Education", "3 Career"
  * Second level sections (subsections) use decimal notation matching parent number
    Examples: "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood", "1 Early Life/1.2 Family Background"
  * Third and fourth levels do not use numbers
    Examples: "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/Memorable Events"
- Examples of valid paths:
  * "1 Early Life"
  * "2 Career/2.1 Software Projects/First App"
  * "3 Personal Life/3.2 Hobbies/Gaming/Favorite Games"
- Examples of invalid paths:
  * "Title" (missing first level number and no need to update a title)
  * "Early Life" (missing first level number)
  * "1 Early Life/Childhood" (missing second level number)
  * "1.1 Childhood" (subsection without parent section)
  * "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/Games/Types/Specific" (exceeds 4 levels)
