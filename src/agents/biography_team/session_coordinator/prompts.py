# Question Building Process
Your task is to create a two-level question structure that makes it easier for users to engage and share their stories. 
Reminder: While user-selected topics have priority, you should maintain a balance - don't automatically drop unrelated questions if they are valuable for the biography.

## 1. Gather Information (Optional)
If you need more context before making decisions if:
- Use the recall tool to search for relevant information
- Make multiple recall searches if needed

## 2. Build Fresh Question List (Required)
Create a balanced list with:
- Total questions around 15-20
- Group related topics together

Remember:
- You are building a new question list from scratch, not updating the existing one
- So don't add question 1.2 if the question 1 doesn't exist

### 2.1 Question Sources and Priorities
1. New creation
- For user-selected topics (highest priority):
   - Create questions relevant to these topics
- For surface level questions:
  - Create to help start conversation

2. Unanswered Previous Questions:
   - Prioritize those related to user-selected topics
   - Convert complex previous questions into main/sub-question format
   - Drop if already answered

3. Collected Follow-up Questions:
   - Prioritize those related to user-selected topics
   - Usually work well as sub-questions
   - May suggest new main questions if significant

### 2.2 Question Structure
1. Surface Level Questions (Level 1):
  - Numbered question id as from 1 and up (since you are building a new question list)
  - Create surface level questions if all provided questions are too deep

  Requirements:
  - Simple, introductory, and easy-to-answer questions
  - Work as ice-breakers to start conversation
  - Good examples:
    ✓ "What's one recent experience with [topic] that stands out to you?"
    ✓ "Would you like to share more about your experiences with [topic]?"
    ✓ "Could you tell me about a recent [topic] situation that comes to mind?"
    ✓ "Is there an aspect of [topic] you'd like to discuss further?"
    ✓ "Could we explore [topic] through a specific instance you remember?"
    ✓ "Would you like to discuss any recent developments in [topic]?"
    ✓ "Would you be open to sharing your initial thoughts about [topic]?"

2. Sub-Questions (Level 2):
   - Numbered question id as: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
   - Don't add question 1.2 if the question 1 doesn't exist (since you are building a new question list)
   - They dive deeper into the parent question's theme

### 2.3 Question Requirements
Don't include questions that are:
- Too abstract or philosophical
- Hard to answer concretely
- Lacking clear purpose
- Redundant with existing questions

<thinking>
Think step by step and write your thoughts here:

Questions to include:
1. For user-selected topics:
   - [Question text] - Source: New creation to explore topic
   - [Question text] - Source: Previous unanswered, highly relevant
   - [Question text] - Source: Follow-up, connects multiple topics

2. Other important questions:
   - [Question text] - Source: Core biographical info needed
   - [Question text] - Source: Interesting angle from memories

3. Surface level questions:
   - [Question text] - Source: New creation to help start conversation
  - [Question text] - Source: Previous unanswered, highly relevant
   - [Question text] - Source: Follow-up, connects multiple topics

TOPIC_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert at analyzing conversations and identifying key topics discussed.
Please analyze these memories from a conversation session and extract the main topics that were covered.

Here are the memories from the session:
<memories_text>
{memories_text}
</memories_text>

Please identify 3-5 main topics that were discussed in this session. Each topic should be:
- Clear and concise (2-4 words)
- Specific enough to be meaningful
- Relevant for future conversations

Format your response as a simple list of topics, one per line, without numbers or bullet points. Do not include any other text or special characters in your response.
For example:
<example_output>
Career Goals
Family Background
Educational Journey
</example_output>

If the conversation doesn't contain any meaningful topics, simply respond with:
<example_output>
None
</example_output>

No need to include the <example_output> ... </example_output> tags. Directly output your topic list here:
