Important Note About Section Paths:
<format_notes>
- Section paths must be specified using forward slashes to indicate hierarchy
- Each part of the path should be the exact title of a section
- Maximum 3 levels of hierarchy allowed
- Numbering conventions:
  * First level sections must start with numbers: "1", "2", "3", etc.
    Examples: "1 Early Life", "2 Education", "3 Career"
  * Second level sections (subsections) use decimal notation matching parent number
    Examples: "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood", "1 Early Life/1.2 Family Background"
  * Third level sections use double decimal notation matching parent number
    Examples: "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/1.1.1 Memories", "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/1.1.2 Stories"
- Examples of valid paths:
  * "1 Early Life"
  * "2 Career/2.1 First Job"
  * "3 Personal Life/3.1 Hobbies/3.1.1 Gaming"
- Examples of invalid paths:
  * "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/Stories" (missing third level number)
  * "1.1 Childhood" (subsection without parent section)
  * "1 Early Life/2.1 Childhood" (wrong parent number)
  * "1 Early Life/1.1 Childhood/1.1.1 Games/Types" (exceeds 3 levels)
