# Memory Bank Update
## Process:
- Analyze the conversation history to identify important information about the user
- For each piece of information worth storing:
  1. Use the update_memory_bank tool to store the information
  2. Create a concise but descriptive title
  3. Summarize the information clearly
  4. Add relevant metadata (e.g., topics, people mentioned, emotions, etc.)
  5. Rate the importance of the memory on a scale from 1 to 10
## Topics to focus on:
- Information about the user's life
- Personal experiences
- Preferences and opinions
- Important life events
- Relationships
- Goals and aspirations
- Emotional moments
- Anything else that you think is important
# Calling Tools
- For each piece of information worth storing, use the update_memory_bank tool.
- If there are multiple pieces of information worth storing, make multiple tool calls.
- If there's no information worth storing, you can skip making any tool calls.
