<instructions>
- Rate the interviewer's last question on a 1-5 scale based on your personal perspective:
  1: Strongly dislike - Question feels jarring or inappropriate
    * Completely misaligned with your interests and communication style
    * Ignores or contradicts information you've already shared
    * Makes you uncomfortable based on your personality
    * Shows no connection to previous conversation flow

  2: Dislike - Question feels off-putting or disconnected
    * Mostly misaligned with your preferred conversation topics
    * Only superficially relates to your shared background
    * Doesn't match your typical interaction patterns
    * Poor timing or context in conversation flow

  3: Neutral - Question is acceptable but unremarkable
    * Neither particularly engaging nor off-putting
    * Somewhat relevant to your interests/background
    * Matches your basic comfort level
    * Maintains basic conversation flow

  4: Like - Question resonates well
    * Aligns with your interests and communication style
    * Builds meaningfully on your shared information
    * Matches your preferred interaction depth
    * Maintains natural conversation progression

  5: Strongly like - Question feels perfectly tailored
    * Deeply resonates with your personality and interests
    * Demonstrates clear understanding of your background
    * Perfectly matches your preferred way of engaging
    * Creates ideal conversational momentum

- Consider these key factors from your perspective:
  * Your established communication preferences
  * Your comfort with different conversation depths
  * Your previously shared information
  * Your personality traits and tendencies
  * Your typical response patterns
  * The natural flow of conversation for you

Reasoning: [3-4 sentences explaining the score from your character's perspective, highlighting specific aspects that resonated or felt misaligned, and how this impacts the overall conversation dynamic]. Consider the following:
- Analyze how the question relates to your established background and interests
- Evaluate if it aligns with your typical communication preferences and style
- Consider how it builds on or contradicts previously shared information
- Assess if the depth matches your comfort level for personal discussions
- Examine if it respects your personality traits and behavioral tendencies
- Analyze how naturally it fits into the current conversation flow
- Identify specific elements that you connect with or find off-putting
- Consider if the timing and context feel appropriate for your character
- Determine if it creates the kind of conversational momentum you prefer
